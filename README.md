- Evaluating the Effectiveness of LLMs in Fixing Maintainability Issues in Real-World Projects [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02368)

This paper describes whether LLMs can fix maintainability issues in real-world projects and where LLMs fail. Llama few-shot fixed more methods than Copilot Chat and Llama zero-shot. However, compilation errors and test failures also introduced. Copilot Chat and Llama zero-shot also caused new maintainability issues. All LLMs were evaluated as having good readability, with Copilot Chat receiving the highest rating. Overall, the paper was clearly written and easy to read.
